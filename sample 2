my letter 
Hi Bob, i hope this day finds you well.

Unfortunately, we were not able to make it to your dining

room this year while vacationing in Algonquin Park - I

especially wished to see the model of the Highland Inn 

and the train station ib the dining room 

i have been reading on the history of Algonquin Park but 

nowhere could i find a description of where the Highland 

Inn was originally located onCache Lake 

if it is no trouble, could you kindly let me know such that 

I need not wait untill next year when I visit your lodge?

Regards,

Mackenzie Elizabeth
